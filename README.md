I made frontend using react.js and backend using spring boot(java).

This website is for displaying lots of chirstmas cakes for sale on the internet using spring boot crawling.

# Frontend

npm install
npm start
```

# Backend

You can run my backend using this command.
```bash
./gradlew build
cd build/libs
java -jar hello-spring-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
